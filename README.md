# Password Generator
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/cagreer18/password-generator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/cagreer18/password-generator)

This password generator is meant to help anyone come up with secure passwords/phrases. Also, it is meant to help explain the methods used if the user wishes to hand generate words/phrases.

Ultimately, this project is used to help me work on a bite-size project while being secure. That said, I hope to raise awareness that making secure passwords can be easy for anyone given the proper direction.

Note: 'Password' and 'passphrase' are used interchangeably to describe any sequence of characters used to protect an account.
