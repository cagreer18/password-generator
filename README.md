# Password Generator
This password generator is meant to help anyone come up with secure passwords/phrases. Also, it is meant to help explain the methods used if the user wishes to hand generate words/phrases.

Ultimately, this project is used to help me work on a bite-size project while making it secure. That said, I hope to raise awareness that making secure passwords can be easy for anyone given the proper direction.

Note: 'Password' and 'passphrase' are used interchangealbly to describe any sequence of characters used to protect an account.
